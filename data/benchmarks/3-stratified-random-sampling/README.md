# Stratified random sampling

These YAML files describe all the benchmarks in three different suites.

These are the benchmarks in `../2-filtered-trivial-and-unsat` but
with the benchmarks from `QF_BVFP` and `QF_BV` sampled (
stratified random sampling).

The benchmarks that correspond to the YAML files are in the `benchmarks/`
directory.  See [README.md](benchmarks/README.md) for more details.
