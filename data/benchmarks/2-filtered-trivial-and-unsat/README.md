# Unsat and trivial filtered benchmarks

These YAML files describe all the benchmarks in three different suites.

These are the benchmarks in `../1-relabelled-benchmarks/` but with
benchmarks with `expected_sat: unsat` removed and with trivial
(see `benchmarks_trivial_annotations`) benchmarks removed.
