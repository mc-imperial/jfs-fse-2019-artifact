# Solver configuration

These YAML files describe the configuration of each solver.
These are used by the `smt-runner` infrastructure to run
the experiments.

The files mention `mars` because `mars` is the machine that
the experiments were run on. The YAML files contain settings
that are specific to `mars` and will likely not work on other
machines (unless they have the same CPU configuration).

If you want to reproduce experiments using the configs in
`../generic`.
