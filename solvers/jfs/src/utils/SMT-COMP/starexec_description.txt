# JFS

JFS is a proto type JIT Fuzzing Solver. It designed to operate on
the QF_BV, QF_FP, and QF_FPBV theories.

JFS takes as input an SMT query, from which it generates a C program
with a sequence of `if` branches, each corresponding to an
assert from the query.  The program is constructed such that finding
an input to the program that traverses all the `true` edges of the
branches is equivalent to finding a satisfying assignment to all the
free variables of the SMT query. To find such an input, a
high performance coverage guided fuzzer is used.

**NOTE**:
Currently the fuzzing implementation in JFS is not finished so the `dummy`
solver is being used which means satisfiability/unsatisfiability can only be
shown for trivial benchmarks.
